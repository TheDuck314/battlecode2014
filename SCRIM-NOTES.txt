team069 - 1260/3
   Does a HQ noise tower + pastr strategy, with fairly dumb but sometimes effective
   noise tower herding.
   WOULD HAVE LOST TO THEM EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE HQ BUG

team018 - NP-Compete
   Does a HQ noise tower + multiple pastr strategy (I think multiple pastrs is dumb)
   with circular herding, which is pretty fast and effect on the right maps.
   WOULD HAVE LOST TO THEM EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE HQ BUG

team117 - Fragments of a Hologram Rose
   HAS SOME REALLY COOL PATHFINDING: SEE GAME 752
   with framework-1-9: they built all pastrs early, I punished them and won

team056 - baumteam
   with framework-1-9: they try to use soldiers to herd into pastrs next to HQ
                       they synchronize the herding of a bunch of soldier.
                       it didn't work well, so I won with a single well-placed pastr

team225 - The Simple Soldier
   with framework-1-9: they built too many pastrs, and I punished them and won
   
team133 - Proxy 2 Gate
   INTERESTING STAND-OFFISH MICRO: WATCH MATCH 292; MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN MINE
   with framework-1-9: (match 292) G#1: they build 2 pastrs, I built 1,
                                        all pastrs were destroyed, I rebuilt mine and wo
                                   G#2: they neglected to build pastrs, so I won with 1.

team009 - Noob Status
   REALLY NICE BUG + ROAD HEURISTIC PATHFINDING. MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT THE BFS IS SLOWING ME DOWN A LOT
   NICE SOLDIER HERDING INTO CORNERS STRATEGY
   with framework-1-9: (match 305) G#1: they built 2 pastrs in corners and used soldiers to herd into them
                                        worked really well! I lost
                                   G#2: he got confused b/c Reticle doesn't have corners, and I won
                                   G#3: another open map; they herded into corners and won

team052 - The Vegan Police
   LESSON: WHEN I COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY, DON'T LET HIM REBUILD
   with framework-1-9: he has decent straight-line soldier herding. but I caught his herders one by one and annihilated them when I attacked

team038 - FireAnts
   NICE CIRCULAR HERDING STRATEGY (EACH SOLDIER HERDS 180 DEGREES AS IT ARRIVES), BUT WEAK TO ATTACKS

team027 - Armada
   DIDN'T BUILD PASTRS, ONLY ATTACKED MINE (ONE AT A TIME...)
