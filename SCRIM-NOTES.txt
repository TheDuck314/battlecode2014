team117 - Fragments of a Hologram Rose
   with framework-1-9: they built all pastrs early, I punished them and won

team056 - baumteam
   with framework-1-9: they try to use soldiers to herd into pastrs next to HQ
                       they synchronize the herding of a bunch of soldier.
                       it didn't work well, so I won with a single well-placed pastr

team225 - The Simple Soldier
   with framework-1-9: they built too many pastrs, and I punished them and won

   INTERESTING STAND-OFFISH MICRO: WATCH MATCH 292; MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN MINE
   Their micro actually sucked as of 1/9. But the stand-offishness is a good idea.
   with framework-1-9: (match 292) G#1: they build 2 pastrs, I built 1,
                                        all pastrs were destroyed, I rebuilt mine and wo
                                   G#2: they neglected to build pastrs, so I won with 1.

team009 - Noob Status
   REALLY NICE BUG + ROAD HEURISTIC PATHFINDING. MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT THE BFS IS SLOWING ME DOWN A LOT
   NICE SOLDIER HERDING INTO CORNERS STRATEGY
   with framework-1-9: (match 305) G#1: they built 2 pastrs in corners and used soldiers to herd into them
                                        worked really well! I lost
                                   G#2: he got confused b/c Reticle doesn't have corners, and I won
                                   G#3: another open map; they herded into corners and won

team052 - The Vegan Police
   LESSON: WHEN I COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY, DON'T LET HIM REBUILD
   with framework-1-9: he has decent straight-line soldier herding. but I caught his herders one by one and annihilated them when I attacked

team038 - FireAnts
   NICE CIRCULAR HERDING STRATEGY (EACH SOLDIER HERDS 180 DEGREES AS IT ARRIVES), BUT WEAK TO ATTACKS

team027 - Armada
   DIDN'T BUILD PASTRS, ONLY ATTACKED MINE (ONE AT A TIME...)
   
team178 - @Deprecated
   REALLY NICE ATTACK MICRO THAT ANNIHILATED ME WITH A RUSH
   How their micro seems to work: they hold off until they have a numbers advantage. They signal
   to each other so that bots that can't see the fight will join it. They don't walk into double-teams.
   They completely wipe the floor with me with equal numbers.
